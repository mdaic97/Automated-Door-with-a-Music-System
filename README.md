# Automated-Door-with-a-Music-System
// Programming for Mechanical Engineers


Designed and coded an automated door with a music system using Arduino IDE

The speaker plays a melody when an object is closer than 25 cm from the sensor and the servo acts as a hinge and rotates to open the door when the object is closer than 15 cm

Created a dictionary of all the tunes for the melody instead of using pre-written codes to provide more flexibility
