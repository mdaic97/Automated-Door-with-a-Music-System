# Automated-Door-with-a-Music-System
Programming for Mechanical Engineers


Designed and coded an automated door with music using Arduino and coding in Linux

The speaker played a melody when an object came close within 25 cm of the sensor and the motor rotated to open the door when the distance within 15 cm

Created a dictionary of all the tunes for the melody instead of using pre-written codes to give more flexibility
